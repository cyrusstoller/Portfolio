  <i class="icon-lock"></i>
  <%= link_to "Data Mustard (live)", "http://datamustard.com/" %>
  &mdash; Github for data analysis
  <small> &mdash; code samples available upon request</small>
</h4>
<blockquote>Think of it as Github for data analysis, but instead of merging versions together, Data Mustard tracks analyses as they fan out.
  Applications like SPSS and Stata produce endless output files that are overwhelming and difficult to track, especially when multiple people 
  are performing analyses on the same data set. With Data Mustard, users wonâ€™t need to search through "sent" mail for analyses that have 
  already been performed.
  <br><br>
  Data Mustard provides a better framework for tracking analyses. Data Mustard does for analyses what Facebook and LinkedIn 
  have done for the Rolodex.

  This is a Stumble Upon for videos that maintains surprisingly high quality.

<blockquote>It's hard to decide where to go on vacation. Searching Google or buying a Lonely Planet is helpful, but it feels stiff. It's really helpful to see the types of experiences that your friends had when they were there. Until now, you've had to go to each friend's profile and browse through all of their pictures, which takes forever. Now you can just search by geolocation. It's as simple as that.
