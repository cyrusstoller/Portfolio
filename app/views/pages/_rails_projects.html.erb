<blockquote>Classy Letters is an easy way to send a unique handwritten letter without having to go to the post office. Whether it's a "Thank
  you," a special card to Mom on Mother's day, or a love letter to your special someone, they'll be talking about this Classy Letter for a long 
  time. There's no need to buy stationary or make sure you have stamps and an envelope. Show your colleagues, family, and friends that you care.

<blockquote>When we get together with friends it's fun to share videos we've seen. When you need a break from your work and 
  have already watched all of the movies that your friends have shared on Facebook and Twitter you need another place to turn to.
  The goal was too keep this restricted to only high quality funny videos.

  <%= link_to "Data Mustard", "http://datamustard.com/" %>
  <small> &mdash; code samples available upon request</small>
</h4>
<blockquote>Think of it as "Github for data analysis", but instead of merging versions together, Data Mustard tracks analyses as they fan out.
  Applications like SPSS and Stata produce endless output files that are overwhelming and difficult to track, especially when multiple people 
  are performing analyses on the same data set. With Data Mustard, users wonâ€™t need to search through "sent" mail for analyses that have 
  already been performed.
  <br><br>
  Data Mustard provides a better framework for tracking analyses. Data Mustard does for analyses what Facebook and LinkedIn 
  have done for the Rolodex.

<blockquote>This is an experiment to determine how people conceptualize the relations between knowledge, information, and truth in a 
  digital age. This site tests the relationship between these beliefs and how participants use multiple text sources to answer academic
  questions.
