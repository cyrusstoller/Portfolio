<h3>iOS Applications</h3>
<p>
  I contributed features and fixed bugs in these apps. I found my roommate using 
  <%= link_to "Big Words", "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/big-words/id296290510" %> on my iPad in an auditorium full 
  of students moving to Palo Alto.

<blockquote>I've also written an iPhone app to help you find places to eat when road tripping. I hate Yelping a restaurant that looked
  appetizing, only to find out that it's 5 miles in the wrong direction. The app I wrote filters Yelp results, so you only see ones in 
  the direction that you're driving. Unfortunately, Yelp was going to make me pay for more than 1000 API calls in 24 hours, so I scrapped it.
