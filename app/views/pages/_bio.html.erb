      Thanks for visiting <%= link_to "cyrusstoller.com", root_path %>. I double majored in Computer Science and Math at 
      <%= link_to "Swarthmore College", "http://www.swarthmore.edu/" %>. 
      I'm always curious to figure out how things work, whether that means looking at source code, 
      proving a theorem, or taking a screwdriver to a gizmo. This site is dedicated to sharing some projects I've been working on.
